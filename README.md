# Mike's official /new/ minimalistic website

There's so much bloat that I'm just too lazy to update it all the time and migrate old code.

This time I focus on simplicity.

Deploy command cuz I'm forgetting all the time:
`sudo npm install -g firebase-tools`
`firebae login`
`firebase deploy --only hosting:mike-czyz-website`
